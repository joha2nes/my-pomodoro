# my-pomodoro
A simple pomodoro windows app with a fixed notification interval. On the start and end of a break, a small window pops up to notify the user. The app can be set to start automatically when the pc is started.

This app was primarily made for myself. I noticed that most pomodoro apps out there did not have this auto start function, which sometimes made me forget using it, and often the timer was not fixed, so it didn't always suit well with other schedules, like lunch time in work. I just wanted something super simple.

One limitation is that the time interval for the notification is set when the program is compiled, so it cannot be changed through some UI or similar.
